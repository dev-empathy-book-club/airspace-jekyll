This episode, we opened up an old classic, Fred Brooks'
[The Mythical Man-Month][Mythical Man-Month].

After some initial impressions, including our collective astonishment at the
degree of gendered language in the book (and thoughts about what impact it might
have had in its time), we moved on to discuss some concepts emerging from the
reading:

* [8:39][times changing] How have ideas in this book survived and evolved over time?
* [14:43][Brooks' Law] Brooks' Law: "Adding human resources to a late software project makes it later."
* [16:56][changes in communication style] Changes in modern communication styles in tools
* [21:42][onboarding] Have we gotten any better at onboarding?
* [23:56][documentation] Have we lost the value of documentation?
* [26:46][surgical teams] The Surgical Team paradigm, reexamined
* [31:41][disappearing architect] Consistency and top-down design versus bottom-up design by consensus
* [42:19][small teams] Small teams
* [46:06][language choice] Choice of programming language
* [52:48][closing] Closing comments
  * [Avdi Grimm on meaningful improvements to programming languages][Avdi Grimm]

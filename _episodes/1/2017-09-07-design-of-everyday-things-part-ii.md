This episode wraps up our discussion of Don Norman's
[The Design of Everyday Things][The Design of Everyday Things].

Following initial reflections on blamelessness and cognitive biases, we spoke
about a number of topics emerging from our reading:

* [06:20][hindsight] Everything makes sense in hindsight; foresight is _hard!_
* [11:53][5 whys] Seeking deeper reasons for events using The 5 Whys
* [18:50][Swiss cheese model] The Swiss cheese model of error, and building resilient systems
* [24:46][sensibility checks] Sensibility checks and machine learning
* [35:05][multiple perspectives] Including multiple perspectives in business decisions
* [48:11][designing processes] Applying principles of design to human processes, e.g. Agile
* [56:27][different tools different failures] Using different tools to catch different types of failures
* [57:17][moralizing] The effect of moralizing on adoption of a practice
* [1:03:42][closing] Closing comments

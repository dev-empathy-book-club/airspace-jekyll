We've been reading [The Design of Everyday Things][The Design of Everyday Things],
by Don Norman, learning to apply the principles of design to code and products,
and see examples in everyday life.

Following initial reflections, we spoke about a number of topics:

* [06:23][design in games] Design in games
* [10:54][real users] The need to design for actual, not abstract, users
* [21:57][changing communities] Communities develop and evolve standards by accident
* [25:28][optimization] Community and team standards aren't right or wrong, just optimizing in a situation for particular priorities
* [29:15][questioning relevance] Are the book's design processes less relevant when you can redesign the product after it's been released?
* [33:59][skeuomorphic design] Skeuomorphic design, slow changes, and iconography
* [39:02][new design imitates old design] New software tools imitate old software tools
* [42:24][making memory unnecessary] Converting "knowledge in the head" into "knowledge in the world"
* [47:05][design of a codebase] Design in the context of a codebase
* [51:17][accidental affordances] Accidental affordances becoming strong signifiers, and how bad decisions tend to replicate themselves
* [55:28][creating knowledge] Creating "knowledge in the world" purposefully... or accidentally
* [57:58][human error] Being confused about accomplishing a technical task doesn't mean you have to insult yourself or the tool
* [1:03:37][designing coding tools] The role of design in coding tools

We'd love to hear your thoughts about the book as well.  [Join us on Slack][join us]

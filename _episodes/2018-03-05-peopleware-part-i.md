This episode, we began our discussion of [Peopleware][Peopleware], by Tom DeMarco
and Timothy Lister.  Initially, we noted that we both found it interesting to
watch how the ideas in Peopleware have been slowly adopted, or met with great
resistance, over the decades since its writing.

Then we got into the nitty-gritty details:

* [5:46][7 false hopes] The 7 false hopes of software management:
  * [6:32][1 weird trick] Some new trick will send productivity soaring
  * [9:38][fast moving tech] Technology is moving so quickly you'll get passed by
  * [12:12][changing langs] Changing languages will give you huge gains
  * [17:18][backlog productivity] Because of the size of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately
  * [21:39][automate dev] If you're automating everything else, may as well automate software development
  * [27:40][pressure] People will work better when put under a lot of pressure
* [32:20] [theories of value] The Spanish vs. English Theories of Value
* [41:08] [music experiment] The Cornell Music Experiment and the value of silence
* [49:42] [environment] The impact of office environment on the programmer
* [56:55] [office pattern] Architectural patterns for an office
* [1:02:29] [furniture police] The Furniture Police
* [1:05:28][closing thoughts] Closing thoughts

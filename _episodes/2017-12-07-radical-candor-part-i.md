This episode, we opened up our discussion of Kim Scott's
[Radical Candor][Radical Candor].  After reviewing the fundamental theory of the
book and giving some first impressions, we spoke about:

* [13:11][rockstars and superstars] "Rockstars" and "Superstars"
* [24:28][boss friend] Should your boss be your friend? How much must the boss act as a psychologist?
* [35:25][supporting colleagues] Supporting colleagues in non-leadership positions
* [40:31][saying mean things] Radical Candor, or just being mean?
* [51:51][bank account] Is there some truth in the "bank account" approach to relationships?
* [59:49][WWII pilots] What senior developers can learn from WWII pilots
* [1:07:41][Cultural sensitivity] Cultural sensitivity versus racism

We'd love to hear your thoughts about the book as well.  [Join us on Slack][join us]

For our first foray into the wide world of Dev Empathy, we're reading
[Nonviolent Communication][Nonviolent Communication], by Marshall B. Rosenberg.
It describes splitting our communication into distinct layers: observations,
feelings, needs, and requests.

After some [initial reflections][initial reflections] on the book, we moved on
to discuss:

* [16:00][value judgments] Value Judgments vs. Moral Judgments
* [35:04][positive action language] Using Positive Action Language
* [53:09][accepting responsibility] "Have to" vs. "Choose to"
* [1:04:26][realistic] Is NVC realistic? Does it make us sound insincere?
* [1:17:00][applications] How can we apply NVC in daily communication, especially written communication?

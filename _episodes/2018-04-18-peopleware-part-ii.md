This episode, we concluded our discussion of [Peopleware][Peopleware], by Tom
DeMarco and Timothy Lister.  Following some personal reflections on the book,
especially about how it relates to goal-setting and other processes, we spoke
about:

* [10:09][Team Culture and Identity] Team culture/identity vs. company coherence
* [21:25][Culture and D&I Efforts] How work culture alienates people unnecessarily... and how to do better!
* [35:07][Managing Culture] Directing team culture as a manager
* [44:55][Ideal Office Environment] What's the ideal office environment? When is remote work awesome vs. problematic?
* [53:53][Aligning Motivations] Aligning motivations of managers and developers

We'd love to hear your thoughts about the book as well.  [Join us on Slack][join us]

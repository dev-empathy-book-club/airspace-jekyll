This episode, we concluded our discussion of Kim Scott's
[Radical Candor][Radical Candor].  After noting that we both found the second
part more valuable than the first, we got into the nitty-gritty details:

* [5:35][SBI] Situation, Behavior, Impact
* [10:08][Being the boss] Power dynamics and being the boss
* [11:13][Soliciting feedback] The importance of soliciting feedback anonymously, especially as a boss
* [15:30][Giving negative feedback] Experiences giving negative feedback
* [18:20][New ideas] Freshness of this book compared with classics
* [20:30][Gender] Gender, gendered language, and Radical Candor
* [33:58][Speaking factually] Speaking factually as a partial mitigation of sexist rejection of valid criticism
* [39:00][Identity politics] The Radical Candor approach to identity politics
* [43:04][Not always gender bias] It's not always about gender bias... but speak factually to make sure it isn't
* [47:26][Big Decision, Big Debate] Splitting "Big Decision" and "Big Debate" meetings
* [54:19][Explicit culture] Being proactive and explicit about company culture
* [1:03:11][Flexibility of values] Values should be longstanding; their implementation should be flexible
* [1:09:54][Closing thoughts] Closing thoughts

We'd love to hear your thoughts about the book as well.  [Join us on Slack][join us]

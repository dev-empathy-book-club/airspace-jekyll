            <h2>What is the Dev Empathy Book Club?</h2>
            <p>The idea is simple. The results just might amaze you.</p>
          </div>
          <p>As software developers, we all learn at some point that technical skills alone aren't sufficient. Success and growth in our careers depends on becoming better at soft skills - more empathetic, more caring, better listeners, stronger team players. Together, we'll draw inspiration from general empathy-related works, as well as books written specifically for the programming business context, in both cases learning lessons about how to be better developers, and better people.</p>
          <p>The commitment is ambitious but reasonable: One book every 2 months, with discussion held on the forum. The core panel will video chat about the book monthly to provide contrast for your own reading experience.</p>

    <p>Glad you asked!</p>
  
    <p>
    Dev Empathy Book Club (DEBC) was founded in early 2017 to create a forum where
    software developers can improve their empathy skills by reading new ideas and
    talking about them with others.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    The public perception of devs is as a group of antisocial, mathematics-oriented,
    technically-minded people. Yet in reality, our professional success is all about
    communication, understanding other people, and meeting real needs.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    DEBC is for developers who want to express that recognition, broaden their
    exposure, deepen their social consciousness, and make the world of
    software&mdash;and the world at large!&mdash;a happier, healthier, more
    empathetic place.

  <h2>The Dev Empathy Book Club Mission</h2>

  <p>
  Software developers have a problem.
  </p>

  <p>
  We're constantly told we need to get better at empathy skills. But all the
  encouragement in the world won't help us figure out <em>how</em> to make that
  happen.
  </p>

  <p>
  Dev Empathy Book Club was founded to answer that challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
  <strong>We are the world's most supportive community of programmers committed
  to developing our empathy skills through study, discussion, and
  practice.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
  Looking to broaden your exposure, improve your communication skills, and
  share stories with a supportive audience as we all learn from the laboratory
  of real life? You've come to the right place.
  </p>

  <p>
  So <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/devempathybookclub/shared_invite/MjExMTA4MjU0MDM3LTE0OTk3NzkwMjItYmExZmRkOWI4Ng">join us</a>!
  We look forward to learning from your experiences.
